    """Abstract Obelisk estimator class.

    Obelisk estimators are stateful. That is, all the quantities required to compute the estimate are stored in the
    estimator object itself. This is done because the processes generating each of these quantities may act
    asynchronously. Similarly, the state estimate may be queried asynchronously.

    When implementing a new ObeliskEstimator, the user should declare all quantities required to compute the state
    estimate in the constructor. These quantities should be updated by various update_X methods. Finally, the
    compute_estimate method should be implemented to compute the state estimate using the updated quantities. Note that
    the estimate message should be of type ObeliskEstimatorMsg to be compatible with the Obelisk ecosystem.

    A template for the update functions could be the following:
    ```
    from obelisk_py.obelisk_typing import ObeliskSensorMsg


    def update_X(self, X_msg: ObeliskSensorMsg) -> None:
        # internal logic that extracts quantity X from the message...
        self.X = X  # update the internal state
    ```
