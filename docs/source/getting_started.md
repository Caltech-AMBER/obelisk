# Getting Started
All instructions in this section assume you are using Ubuntu 22.04. The development dependencies should be installed when `dev_setup.sh` is run from the repository root.

## Using Docker
We highly recommend using `docker` to containerize our code. This provides consistent environments and makes it easy to share code with others.
